## Project Status

This project is currently in progress. The first version is complete which
allows players to play against the computer.

Here's a list of features to implement in future versions:
* Responsive for various screen sizes (mobile/tablet).
* Option to play against another player or the computer.
* **Play Again** button for when game is over (currently have to refresh the page).

## Reflection

This was a 3-4 day learning-project completed via **The Odin Project** (link above). The game was originally implemented using only the Developer Tools console, and some `prompt()` requests for the player's selection. The final task was to create a simple front-end with some buttons for entering a player's input and display the running score.

The project was a good learning experience and my accomplishments include:
* Dynamically changing websites using JavaScript event listeners.
* Manipulating the DOM by changing the tree-structure with JavaScript.
